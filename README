This is Scott's Home Automation Controller project.

It controls several different things:

  * Somfy Blinds via a Sonfy Universal RTS Interface and a Global Cache iTach

  * Lights and Ceiling Fan via an ISY-994i
 
  * Scott's Pandora Player (custom build) - power, song skip

The human interface consists of:

  * 16 Cherry MX-Blue keyswitches, each with a built-in LED

  * Noritake 16x2 VFD display to display Song and Artist

Notes:
   uses the ioexpand and keypad objects from the pi nixieclock

Crontab:
   @reboot bash /home/pi/start_controller.sh &> /dev/null
